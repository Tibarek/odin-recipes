        <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>6 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 medium oranges, zested</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>  
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt).
            </li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Beat white sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. 
                Beat in eggs one at a time, then beat in vanilla extract and orange zest. 
                Add flour alternately with sour cream in 3 additions, beginning and ending with flour. 
                Beat until smooth. 
                Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. 
                Spread evenly in the prepared pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
                Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then unmold the cake onto the wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the cake is cooling, bring orange juice, sugar, and orange zest to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and cook until syrupy, about 15 minutes. 
                Remove from heat and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Drizzle warm syrup over cake slices.
            </li>
        </ol>
